# eleventy-test
Eleventy is hands-down my favourite generator. I also make plugins for them! so [after a while of brute forcing my Eleventy testing](https://github.com/Denperidge/eleventy-auto-cache-buster/tree/14787bebe3bb73f4c6bd971196f3bec87812044f/tests), I thought an easier solution should exist.
- Build multiple Eleventy configurations & versions for your tests
- Compatible with *any* test framework
- Aside from Eleventy versions to test with, package itself has **zero** dependencies.

Want to see how it in action? For the dogfooding fans, you can see this library in action in this [library's tests](tests/)!
